# 🔧 Vercel Deployment Fix

## ✅ Issue Fixed
The deployment error was caused by an invalid `functions` configuration in `vercel.json`. This has been fixed by removing the unnecessary functions configuration.

## 🚀 How to Redeploy

### Option 1: Automatic Redeploy (Recommended)
1. **Go to your Vercel dashboard**
2. **Find your project** in the dashboard
3. **Click "Redeploy"** button
4. **Wait for deployment** to complete

### Option 2: Manual Redeploy
1. **Go to Vercel dashboard**
2. **Click on your project**
3. **Go to "Deployments" tab**
4. **Click the three dots** on the latest deployment
5. **Select "Redeploy"**

### Option 3: Trigger New Deployment
1. **Make a small change** to any file (like adding a space)
2. **Commit and push** to GitHub
3. **Vercel will automatically deploy** the new version

## 🔍 What Was Fixed

### Before (Causing Error):
```json
{
  "functions": {
    "src/app/api/**/*.ts": {
      "runtime": "nodejs18.x"
    }
  }
}
```

### After (Fixed):
```json
{
  "framework": "nextjs",
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "devCommand": "npm run dev",
  "installCommand": "npm install",
  "outputDirectory": ".next"
}
```

## ✅ Verification Steps

1. **Check build logs** - Should show successful build
2. **Visit your portfolio URL** - Should load without errors
3. **Test all sections** - Navigation, projects, contact form
4. **Check mobile responsiveness** - Test on different devices

## 🎯 Expected Result

Your portfolio should now deploy successfully and be accessible at:
- **Vercel URL**: `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`
- **Custom Domain**: If you've set one up

## 🆘 If Still Having Issues

### Check Vercel Logs:
1. Go to your project dashboard
2. Click on the failed deployment
3. Check "Build Logs" for any remaining errors

### Common Solutions:
- **Clear Vercel cache** and redeploy
- **Check Node.js version** (should be 18.x or 20.x)
- **Verify all dependencies** are properly installed

### Contact Support:
- **Vercel Support**: support.vercel.com
- **GitHub Issues**: Create an issue in your repository

## 🎉 Success!

Once deployed successfully, you can:
1. **Add the URL to your resume**
2. **Share with potential employers**
3. **Update your LinkedIn profile**
4. **Add to your email signature**

Your portfolio is ready to impress! 🚀
